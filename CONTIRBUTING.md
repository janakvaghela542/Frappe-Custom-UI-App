## ‚úÖ Getting Started

To contribute code, documentation, or report bugs, follow these basic steps:

## üõ†Ô∏è GitHub Contribution Guide

### Fork, Branch, Commit, and Pull Request (PR)

A step-by-step guide to contributing to an open-source project using GitHub.

---

## üî± 1. Fork the Repository

> Forking creates a personal copy of someone else's repository under your GitHub account.

**Steps:**

1. Navigate to the repository you want to contribute to on GitHub.
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner.
3. GitHub will create a copy of the repository under your own account.

---

## üåø 2. Clone and Create a Branch

> Cloning downloads the repository to your local machine. Branching keeps your work separate from the main code.

**Steps:**

<pre>
# Clone your forked repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git

# Navigate into the cloned repo
cd repository-name

# Create a new branch for your feature or fix
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
</pre>

‚úÖ Replace `your-username` and `repository-name` with your actual GitHub username and the repo name.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/janakvaghela542/Frappe-Custom-UI-App.git
cd Frappe-Custom-UI-App
```

---

## üíæ 3. Make Changes and Commit

> Once you‚Äôve made your changes, you need to commit them with a clear message.

**Steps:**

# Check what has changed

```bash
git status
```

# Stage your changes

```bash
git add .
```

# Commit with a meaningful message

```bash
git commit -m "Add feature X or fix bug Y"
```

üí° Make small, focused commits that describe **why** a change was made.

---

## üöÄ 4. Push and Create a Pull Request (PR)

> Push your branch to your GitHub fork and open a PR to the original repository.

**Steps:**

<pre>
# Push your branch to your fork
git push origin my-feature-branch
</pre>

Then:

1. Go to your fork on GitHub.
2. Click **Compare & pull request**.
3. Add a title and description explaining your changes.
4. Click **Create pull request**.

## 5. Add the Original Repository as Upstream

This allows you to pull in the latest changes from the original repo:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/janakvaghela542/Frappe-Custom-UI-App.git
```

## 6. Set Up Your Development Environment

Make sure you have a working Frappe bench environment. Then install the app:

```bash
# Inside your bench directory
bench get-app frappe_custom_ui_app https://github.com/<your-username>/Frappe-Custom-UI-App.git
bench install-app frappe_custom_ui_app
```

Now you're ready to develop and test your changes.

---

## üîÑ (Optional) Keep Your Fork Updated

> It's a good idea to sync your fork with the original repository.

**Steps:**

<pre>
# Add the original repo as a remote source
git remote add upstream hhttps://github.com/janakvaghela542/Frappe-Custom-UI-App.git

# Fetch latest changes from the original repo
git fetch upstream

# Merge them into your local main branch
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Push updated main to your fork
git push origin main
</pre>

## üôå Final Notes

- Always write **clear commit messages**.
- Use **branches** for different features or fixes.
- Be respectful and follow the repository's **contribution guidelines**.
- Keep your PRs **focused and minimal**.

Click the **Fork** button on the top-right of [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/janakvaghela542/Frappe-Custom-UI-App) to create your own copy.

## üîÑ Development Workflow

1. Create a New Branch

Never work directly on the main branch. Create a descriptive branch name:

```bash
git checkout -b fix-listview-button-visibility
```

2. Make Your Changes

- Follow our Coding Guidelines.
- Test locally before committing.
- Write clear and atomic commits.

3. Commit Your Changes

- Use meaningful commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: corrected visibility issue in ListView custom button"
```

4. Sync with Upstream (if needed)

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

5. Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin fix-listview-button-visibility
```

## ‚ú® Coding Guidelines

Please keep these in mind while writing code:

### General

- Keep your changes focused and modular.

- Avoid mixing unrelated changes in a single PR.

- Follow the Frappe framework‚Äôs conventions and naming patterns.

### Python

- Use snake_case for functions and variables.

- Use docstrings and comments for clarity.

- Format with tools like black or flake8 if available.

### JavaScript

- Use camelCase for variables and functions.

- Keep client-side logic modular.

- Avoid polluting the global scope.

- Use Frappe's built-in utilities where possible.

### HTML/CSS

- Prefer Frappe's inbuilt classes for styling.

- Follow semantic HTML.

- Use scoped or modular styles.

### üß™ Testing Your Changes

- Before submitting your pull request, ensure:

- Your changes work as expected in the Frappe UI.

- You‚Äôve tested the feature with different user roles if applicable.

- No console errors or warnings.

- Any new behavior is documented (comments, inline docs, or external docs).

### üèÅ Pull Request Process

- Once you're ready, follow this to submit a PR:

- Go to your fork and switch to your branch.

- Click "New Pull Request".

- Ensure the base branch is main of the original repo.

- Provide a clear and concise PR description:

- What is the purpose of this change?

- Any related issue links?

- Steps to test the feature/fix.

- Screenshots or video demos if it affects UI.

- Once submitted, a maintainer will review your PR and provide feedback or merge it.

## üè∑ Good First Issues

If you're looking for a place to start:

- Check the Issues tab.

Look for labels like:

- good first issue

- help wanted

- documentation

These are ideal for newcomers and usually well-scoped.

## üêû Reporting Issues
